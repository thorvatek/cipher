# cipher
Simple Cipher This HTML code creates a simple web-based application for encrypting and decrypting messages using a substitution cipher, named the "GERMANIKUS Cipher". The cipher works by generating a unique alphabet based on the keyword "GERMANIKUS" and then mapping letters to their numerical positions for encryption, and vice-versa for decryption.
